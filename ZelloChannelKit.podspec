  spec.description  = <<-DESC
The Zello Channels SDK allows you to integrate Zello push-to-talk into your own application. The SDK communicates with a Zello server over a web socket connection using a JSON-based protocol, and offers a simple API for connecting to a Zello channel and sending and receiving audio. Supported features include:

Send voice messages from the device microphone
Play incoming voice messages through the device speaker
Send voice messages from your own audio code, e.g. from a file
Receive voice message data with your own audio code with optional pass-through to the device speaker
The protocol specification is also available if you prefer to develop your own client in-house.
